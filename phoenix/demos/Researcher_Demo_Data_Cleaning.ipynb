    "### Demostration for Researcher Use Case\n",
    "These notebooks contain a prospective analysis of bird sighting variation due changing air quaility in Oregon. Our analysis focuses on the 2020 Oregon wildfires. Understanding how bird observations change with worsening air quaility could offer insight into how bird populations respond to wildfires. Our main goal is data exploration. We hope that any interesting findings could be used by researchers in future studies. Secondly, we hope to demonstrate some of the functionality of Altair, a descriptive statiscal visualization library, within the context of ecological research.\n",
