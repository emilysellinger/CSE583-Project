## Background
Under climate change, the likelihood of larger wildfires and longer fire seasons in the Western United States is projected to increase. This has already been realized in the past few years, when record-setting fire and smoke events have had considerable impact on the communities and ecology of these regions. To better understand the environmental consequences of future fires, it is useful to examine the outcomes of the recent ones.

We decided that an accessible and meaningful way to do this is to investigate the occurrences of bird observations before, during, and after a wildfire event in a given region. In particular, we are interested in the interaction between avian ecology and air quality as indirect impacts of wildfire, since it is apparent that the fires themselves can displace bird populations and result in direct mortality. In general, birds tend to be more susceptible to air contamination due to the anatomy of their respiratory systemsâ€”a well-known example of this is the use of canaries to warn coal miners of the presence of dangerous gases. And in studies of captive birds and poultry, exposure to smoke has resulted in damaged lung tissue and respiratory infections. 

However, the response and movement of a wild bird population as a result of smoke is not well understood and more difficult to study in detail. The distribution of individuals and air particles is constantly shifting and there may be a variety of behaviors between different taxonomic groups. Describing the regional movement patterns of a species or family, therefore, would be a useful step in understanding the avian ecology of a region impacted by wildfires.

Using detailed citizen scientist data from eBird and air quality data from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, we aim to perform an initial analysis and visualization of bird observation data against PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 micrometers). Due to their recency and significant air quality impact, we seek to provide insight into how the 2020 Oregon wildfires may have impacted observations in the state.

Although this project is motivated from a research perspective, the visualization tool is intended to be accessed by recreational birders, citizen scientists, and Audubon societies. If made widely available as an interactive map on a website, birders will be able to use this information to gain a better understanding of how to adjust their practices and get the most out of their experience.

## Data Sources
**eBird:** All bird sightings/identifications in Oregon from January through November 2020, acquired as raw data from eBird's database (maintained by Cornell Lab of Ornithology). Bird identifications are logged by users on their mobile device, and each datapoint includes a geolocation and bird ID, along with a suite of additional anonymized user and locale identifiers.
